# To Do List App

This is my submission for The Odin Project's [To Do List Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list). 

If a task is marked as complete and its due date is passed, the task is not shown but if its due date has not yet passed, the task is still displayed so the user has a sense of accomplishment. Local storage is used to maintain the users list of tasks and projects.
